# Skin-disease-Classification-using-CNN
This research develops a CNN-based model using EfficientNet and transfer learning for accurate skin disease classification from DermNet images. Data augmentation and dropout ensure robustness against overfitting. The system aims to deliver real-time, scalable predictions with high accuracy and precision for improved healthcare diagnostics.
